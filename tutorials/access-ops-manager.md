### Access Ops Manager

Open your Ops Manager application in a browser to complete configuration. Locate the URL of the LoadBalancer service which was created by the Operator.

```execute
kubectl get svc ops-manager-svc-ext -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}' -n mongodb
```

You may need to wait for some time until the DNS gets populated for the Load Balancer address.

Open the link http://<elb-url>:8080 in your browser. Login to Ops Manager using the credentials you specified in the secret created and pass the wizard steps to finish Ops Manager configuration. Youâ€™ll reach the admin page.
